        "# **Project Summary -** The Bank of England has warned that the number of companies declaring bankruptcy is on the rise, with more than 1,000 in the UK facing the threat of going bust. Prediction of bankruptcy is a phenomenon of increasing interest to firms who stand to lose money because of unpaid debts. Bankruptcy experts are using computers to predict which companies are likely to go bust, since computers can store huge data sets pertaining to bankruptcy, making accurate predictions from them beforehand is becoming important. The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In this project we use various classification algorithms on bankruptcy dataset to predict bankruptcies. Bankruptcy is one of the biggest challenges facing the global financial sector, according to a report published by the Bank of England. Bankruptcy of companies and enterprises effects the financial market at multiple fronts, and hence the need to predict bankruptcy among companies by monitoring multiple variables takes on an added significance. A better understanding of bankruptcy and the ability to predict it will impact affect the profitability of lending institutions worldwide. With that in mind, we undertook the task of building different supervised-machine learning algorithms, along with a comparative analysis of each model, in order to identify those that are better suited for predicting economic bankruptcy. The history of bankruptcy prediction includes application of numerous statistical tools which gradually became available, and involves deepening appreciation of various pitfalls in early analyses. Research is still published that suffers pitfalls that have been understood for many years. Bankruptcy prediction has been a subject of formal analysis since at least 1932, when FitzPatrick published a study of 20 pairs of firms, one failed and one surviving, matched by date, size and industry, in The Certified Public Accountant. He did not perform statistical analysis as is now common, but he thoughtfully interpreted the ratios and trends in the ratios. His interpretation was effectively a complex, multiple variable analysis. The latest research within the field of Bankruptcy and Insolvency Prediction compares various differing approaches, modelling techniques, and individual models to ascertain whether any one technique is superior to its counterparts. The term bankruptcy is expressed as the inability of a company to pay its debts to its creditors. The bankruptcy of a company and even the possibility of going bankrupt is important for the company's investors and society. Therefore, bankruptcy prediction should be made before the bankruptcy of a company and necessary and appropriate models should be built. In this part of the model, we created machine learning algorithms that can predict whether companies will go bankrupt. In this way, it will be possible to predict the bankruptcy of companies with their financial statements and financial ratios. There are more than 6800 companies in the data used in the bankruptcy prediction model. The bankruptcy cases of these companies in the data are shown as 1 (bankrupted) and 0 (failed to go bankrupt) and it is tried to predict whether they will go bankrupt with 95 financial ratios i.e 95 features in the dataset. Our goal is to use these features to have clearer information about the future and legitimacy of the companies."
